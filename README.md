# motion_tracking_CV_bug_detector_2

# Project Overview
This repository contains code for running and training a motion detector for insects in a natural environment. Below is a list of high-level steps outlining the development:
 - OpenCV/NumPy motion tracker
 - Binary ResNet18 image classifier to remove false positives
 - Chip generator for labeling classifier data
 - Retraining script for fine-tuning ResNet18

# Motivation
The impetus for creating this repository/codebase was spurred from my interest in computer vision and its implementation in robotic systems. One example of applied computer vision that piqued my interest was a laserweeding application. In this application, an autonomous system uses computer vision to detect weeds and marks them for removal; thus eliminating the need for harmful herbicides. My interest is to expand on this solution to detect moving targets, such as bugs, and thereby eliminating the need for pesticides.
